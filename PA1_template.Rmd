This is my 'Hello World' Mardown - coincidentally it is also the first Peer Assessment of the Reproducible Research course of Coursera's Data Science Specialization 

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r dataload, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.table(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header = TRUE, sep=",")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
